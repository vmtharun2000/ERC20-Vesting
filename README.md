# ERC20 Token Vesting Smart Contract

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Solidity smart contract for ERC20 token vesting. The vesting smart contract allows for the secure and automated distribution of ERC20 tokens over a predefined vesting period. This feature is commonly used for team members, advisors, or contributors who receive tokens gradually over time.

## Features

- **Automated Vesting**: The smart contract automates the vesting process, releasing ERC20 tokens according to predefined schedules.
- **Customizable Vesting Schedules**: Users can set up customizable vesting schedules based on specific timeframes or milestones.
- **Security**: Implements security measures to ensure the integrity of the vesting process and prevent unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: The smart contract is developed in Solidity, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **ERC20 Standard**: Adheres to the ERC20 token standard for compatibility with a wide range of wallets and platforms.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency and immutability to the vesting process.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you're interested in improving the smart contract, adding new features, or enhancing security, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
